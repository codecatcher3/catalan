The Catalan Conjecture
======================

These files are COPYRIGHTED Chong Shang Shan.

There used to be a paper located here on the Catalan Conjecture.
In it I thought I had a elementary proof of this conjecture, using
concepts simpler than Mihailescu's proof.
This turns out to be wrong. I have discovered an error in my proof.
Hence I withdraw this paper from circulation.

Any copies of it circulating on the internet or Darkweb are all wrong.
